# Intro to Shiny
###### 2022-06-27
The repo was prepared for Intro to Shiny workshops for R User Group Tunisia.

## Goal
The goal of the workshops is to show the basics of Shiny. I will show you some concepts and elements of Shiny that were a game changers for me when I was starting building the Shiny apps. 

## How to use the repo
There are two main folders - examples and exercises. We will go together through examples and after each example you will have an exercise.
We will go through 5 apps, each of them explaining a new concept. App 01 is the most simple one, and each further app extends the previous one.

### Prerequisites
You need two libraries to run the repo

```{r}
install.packages("shiny")
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

## Deploying Shiny apps
- [RStudio Connect](https://www.rstudio.com/products/connect/) - recommended for enterprise Shiny applications
- [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/) - great for personal apps and portfolio
- [ShinyProxy](https://www.shinyproxy.io/) - open source, but requires a lot of maintenance

## Further resorces
